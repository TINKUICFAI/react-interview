E-commerce: You're building a product page. How can you dynamically display product information (name, price, description, etc.) based on the selected product ID?
Forms: When a user submits a form, how can you validate the input fields (e.g., checking if an email is formatted correctly)?
Routing: In a single-page application, how can you manage different views and navigation between them using React Router?

Conditional Rendering: How can you conditionally render content based on certain conditions, like showing a "loading" message while data is being fetched?
Error Handling: How can you handle errors that might occur during API calls or other operations in your React application?
Component Reusability: How can you create reusable components that can be used in different parts of your application to improve code maintainability?
Prop Drilling: How can you avoid excessive prop drilling (passing props down through many levels of components) to manage data flow?
Performance Optimization: How can you optimize the performance of your React application, such as using techniques like memoization or code splitting? 1 Accessibility: How can you ensure your React application is accessible to users with disabilities, following best practices for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility?
Testing: How can you write unit tests for your React components to ensure they behave as expected?
Styling: Beyond basic CSS, how can you use CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Emotion to manage styles in your React application?
